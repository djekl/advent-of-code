This codebase is inspired by [@ryangjchandler](https://github.com/ryangjchandler)'s [repo](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/advent-of-code)

And his related [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cEZC0dDi34&t=2s)

Shamelessly stolen his base code, put provided my own solutions.

To run the code, you need to do the following in the terminal:

```bash
./runner.php 2023/days/1
```

---

To run setup for the next day, you need to do the following in the terminal:

```bash
./new-day.sh
```

This will ask for todays day, and create the folder structure and files for you.
