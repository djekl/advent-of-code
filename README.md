This codebase is inspired by @ryangjchandler's [repo](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/advent-of-code)

And his related [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cEZC0dDi34&t=2s)

Shamelessly stolen his base code, put provided my own solutions.

To run the code, you need to do the following in the terminal:

```bash
php ./runner.php 2023/days/1
```
